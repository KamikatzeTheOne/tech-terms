# Tech Terms

A repository of technical terms and definitions. Eventually to be converted to flashcards or...whatever.

## Plan

The idea is that this list is optimized for rote memorization - so each definition is short and presentable in flash-card format. The theory is that by memorizing this terminology, a beginner will get immediately situated within the terminology of the world of develoment.

- [x] Put together big, unsorted list of terms to define (aim for a few hundred terms)
- [x] Denormalize and flatten list
- [ ] Define terms
- [ ] Create transformer to transform into [Anki](http://ankiweb.net/)
- [ ] Create and administer a poll to figure out the most important terms
- [ ] Create several sets of flashcards of increasing granularity

Terms are written in org mode. For now just give a regular pull request. I'll take care of merging for now.
