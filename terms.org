| Minimum Viable Product (MVP)                         | The smallest feature set that could possibly still be of use. In Agile, it is common to develop the MVP first, distribute it to users, then use feedback to drive future requirements.                                       |

| Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)                          | A software development maxim to avoid creating multiple instances of redundant code. When similar code is needed in two different places prefer to use one of the abstraction features of your programming language.         |
| You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)                      | A programming maxim to avoid coding things that you don't have a direct and immediate need for because in all likelihood, things will change and you will not end up needing it.                                             |
| Law of Demeter / Principle of least knowledge        | Programming rule-of-thumb that a piece of code should minimize how much it needs to know about how any other piece of code works. Ideally, code should only know about and talk to the structures it uses directly.          |
| Single Responsibility Principle                      | Programing principle that a unit of code (function/class/script) should ideally have one responsibility. The only reason it should change is if one of its business requirements change. The S in SOLID.                     |
| Open/Closed Priniciple                               | Programming principle that a unit of code should be easy (open) to extend if requirements are added but only need to change (closed) if its own business requirements change. The O in SOLID.                                |

| Interface Segregation Principle                      | Object oriented design principle stating that an interface should only expose methods that are likely to be used at the same time. Implementing many interfaces is fine, but interfaces should be small. The I in SOLID.     |
| Dependency Inversion Principle                       | Object oriented design principle that code components (function/class/script) should not directly reference other components but should be passed in via a module or constructor injection system. The D in SOLID.           |

| Test Driven Development (TDD)                        | Practice of writing testing code - typically unit tests - before implementing features. Can result in better quality software design as it forces requirements to be stated and understood very explicitly.                  |

| Executable Specification                             | A subset of BDD where developers create mini programming languages that are simple enough for business people to specify - or at least be able to understand the code - of how a program should behave.                      |

| Mutation Testing                                     | A tool that modifies code and runs tests repeatedly. If code can be modified significantly and tests still pass then flagged for further investigation. Useful for finding missed use cases automatically.                   |

| Model View View Model (MVVM)                         | Design pattern commonly used in user interfaces where data in an object contantly reflects the tate of the UI. User interactions change the object and changing the object modifies the interface.                           |
| Object Relational Mapper (ORM)                       | Pattern often used for interfacing with sql/relational databases. The ORM provides a way to interact with language objects and maps changes automatically to the underlying database tables.                                 |

| Unidirectional Dataflow                              | Popular pattern for building user interfaces where every user interaction triggers code that change a single model. The user interface is then recalculated completely from this model. Popular in frameworks like ReactJs.  |
| Microservices                                        | Architectural pattern where a large system is designed as a set of independent smaller applications which talk to each other. Each has its own team and is free to make its own technical decisions. Similar to SOA.         |
| Service Oriented Architecture                        | Architectural pattern similar to microservices where a system is designed as a series of cooperating services. These tend to be more tightly coupled than microservices but can also share code more easily.                 |
| N-Tier / Onion Architecture                          | Architectural pattern where a central "domain" encompasing the application's core logic interacts with a variety of surrounding services. These in turn might be surrounded by yet other services that interact with them.   |

| UTF-8                                                | Binary serialization of numbers (typically generated from a unicode mapping) that optimizes for situations where numbers 0-127 (2^(8-1)) are most common. Variations like UTF-16 and UTF-32 are often used internationally.  |

| JSON                                                 | Format often used for storing simple structured data. Optimized to balance being human readable and easy to edit, while simultaneously being a subset of Javascript and hence valid code.                                    |
| INI                                                  | Older format often used for storing very simple configuration data. Supports very little structure (eg it is not possible to denote an array) but is very easy to read and edit manually.                                    |
| Networking                                           | The act, field, or industry of joining many computers so that applications running on these may communicate with each other. Typically used to describe the lower level activities of how data reaches its destination.      |

| Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI model)       | Conceptual model of how data is transmitted over the network. Composed of seven layers each of which are responsibile for a conceptual step. Eg. the network layer defines how data finds its way along the network.         |
| Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)                  | Specific protocol used by web traffic to ensure data can be sent accross a complex network, arrive at its destination, and be assembled into the correct order. Used to transmit text, images, email, http, etc.             |
| User Datagram Protocol (UDP)                         | Specific protocol used by web traffic to send data accross a complex network. Unlike TCP, it does not ensure that all data arrives at the destination. Used for transmission of media like audio and video.                  |

| Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)                   | Version of IP using 128 bits ("standard" IPv4 uses 32) allowing for far more IP addresses to be available. Represented as a group of hex digits with a colon separator (eg 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).         |
| Domain Name System (DNS)                             | A system of distributed lookup tables that map a domain name (eg google.com) to an IP address. A web request will look up the IP address for the requested url domain name before being sent out over the internet.          |
| Domain Name Registrar                                | A company that sells domain names. When one is sold, it is added to the company's lookup table and will eventually be visible in other registrar's lookup tables as well. Looking up an address (DNS Lookup) is free.        |
| Top Level Domain (TLD)                               | The last ".com", ".org", ".biz", ".uk", etc part of a domain name. TLDs are regulated by the ICANN organization and have to follow ceratain rules (eg the UK manages .uk, universities manage .edu).                         |
| Content Delivery Network (CDN)                       | Business which distributes content in a geographically optimized manner. For example an image requested from a CDN will be sent from a nearby (in network terms) server.                                                     |
