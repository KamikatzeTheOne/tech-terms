| Minimum Viable Product (MVP)                         | The smallest feature set that could possibly still be of use. In Agile, it is common to develop the MVP first, distribute it to users, then use feedback to drive future requirements.                                       |
| Prototype (agile)                                    | Technique for distilling requirements where a rapidly-built, partially functional version of the application is created with the intent of getting feedback from users and throwing it away.                                 |

| Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)                          | A software development maxim to avoid creating multiple instances of redundant code. When similar code is needed in two different places prefer to use one of the abstraction features of your programming language.         |
| You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)                      | A programming maxim to avoid coding things that you don't have a direct and immediate need for because in all likelihood, things will change and you will not end up needing it.                                             |
| Law of Demeter / Principle of least knowledge        | Programming rule-of-thumb that a piece of code should minimize how much it needs to know about how any other piece of code works. Ideally, code should only know about and talk to the structures it uses directly.          |
| Single Responsibility Principle                      | Programing principle that a unit of code (function/class/script) should ideally have one responsibility. The only reason it should change is if one of its business requirements change. The S in SOLID.                     |
| Open/Closed Priniciple                               | Programming principle that a unit of code should be easy (open) to extend if requirements are added but only need to change (closed) if its own business requirements change. The O in SOLID.                                |

| Interface Segregation Principle                      | Object oriented design principle stating that an interface should only expose methods that are likely to be used at the same time. Implementing many interfaces is fine, but interfaces should be small. The I in SOLID.     |
| Dependency Inversion Principle                       | Object oriented design principle that code components (function/class/script) should not directly reference other components but should be passed in via a module or constructor injection system. The D in SOLID.           |

| Test Driven Development (TDD)                        | Practice of writing testing code - typically unit tests - before implementing features. Can result in better quality software design as it forces requirements to be stated and understood very explicitly.                  |

| Automated testing                                    | The practice of writing automated checks that code functions as it should. Includes unit testing, approval testing, integration testing, and an outher automation.                                                           |
| Executable Specification                             | A subset of BDD where developers create mini programming languages that are simple enough for business people to specify - or at least be able to understand the code - of how a program should behave.                      |

| Mutation Testing                                     | A tool that modifies code and runs tests repeatedly. If code can be modified significantly and tests still pass then flagged for further investigation. Useful for finding missed use cases automatically.                   |

| Unidirectional Dataflow                              | Popular pattern for building user interfaces where every user interaction triggers code that change a single model. The user interface is then recalculated completely from this model. Popular in frameworks like ReactJs.  |
| Microservices                                        | Architectural pattern where a large system is designed as a set of independent smaller applications which talk to each other. Each has its own team and is free to make its own technical decisions. Similar to SOA.         |
| Service Oriented Architecture                        | Architectural pattern similar to microservices where a system is designed as a series of cooperating services. These tend to be more tightly coupled than microservices but can also share code more easily.                 |
| N-Tier / Onion Architecture                          | Architectural pattern where a central "domain" encompasing the application's core logic interacts with a variety of surrounding services. These in turn might be surrounded by yet other services that interact with them.   |
